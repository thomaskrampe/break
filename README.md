## Lunchbreak
An easy-to-configure countdown/timer.

## Description
A simple countdown/timer that can be used in full screen mode in online training sessions, meetings, or webinars to display the remaining time during breaks. It can be configured to count down from a specified number of minutes or to a specified time.

## Installation
Simply clone the repository. The web app is located in the public folder. The background image can be customized in `style.css` file.

If necessary, the port can be adjusted in the `Caddyfile`. The `compose.yaml` file is already configured for use behind an Nginx Proxy Manager; if necessary, the network configuration may need to be adjusted here.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
